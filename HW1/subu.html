            <div class="question">What do you teach?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">I like programming and hence, I teach Introduction to programming, Object Oriented Programming and Full Stack Development. In addition, I also teach Artificial Intelligence and Agent Based Modeling, both of which are courses related to my area of research. In my first semester (Spring 2023) at WSU, I will be offering Web Development, Software Testing and the Software Design Project I.</div>
            <div class="question">Why do you like teaching?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">I always enjoyed breaking up a complex idea and communicating it in a way that anybody can understand. When everything clicks, the listeners’ face brightens up and it’s a very gratifying experience. It is very similar to how a Chef feels when he/she sees someone really enjoy a dish that they prepared.</div>
            <div class="question">What does your research consist of? How would you explain it to a class of freshmen?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">We use analogies, metaphors, and similes every day to communicate with each other and to learn new things. All of this comes from our ability to recognize something called relational patterns. I want to find new ways to enable computers to recognize, learn, and utilize relational patterns, just like humans. I believe this is essential for making machines smarter.</div>
            <div class="question">If you could name one person who inspires you, who would it be?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Dr. Venkataraman ‘Venki’ Ramakrishnan is a big inspiration for me. He started from a humble background and became a world-renowned structural biologist. He won the Nobel Prize in 2009 for his contributions. In one of his interviews, he explained the secret of his success. He said that no one should do science for medals, funds, or rewards and doing science is a reward on its own. This idea is always stuck with me and something that I revisit very frequently.</div>
            <div class="question">What advice do you have for students?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">“There is no such thing as a stupid question”. Ask a lot of questions. In my limited experience, I can clearly see a high correlation between students’ willingness to ask questions and how well they do in the class. Don’t let doubts stay dormant, get it clarified when it’s fresh in your mind.</div>
