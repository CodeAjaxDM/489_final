You should run the index.html file using live server as normal. The home site I was given requires most of the professor information to be displayed through the website link,so please click that link to folllow to the second html file. 
Sorry that there are 4 files instead of 2 as asked, but that was how the host page was structured. 
Please note all website and email links ahve been updated to reflect the incoming professor, all other links work for MIT relevant things.
